-- The WHERE clause can contain one or many AND operators.

-- The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Spain that starts with the letter 'G':

Select * from Customers
where country= 'spain' AND customername like 'G%';

-- All Conditions Must Be True

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany'
AND City = 'Berlin'
AND PostalCode > 12000;


-- Combining AND and OR

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
