-- An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.
-- Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.


-- The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column

-- Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).m
