<!-- The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain: -->

select * from customer
where country = 'Germany' OR country = 'Spain';

<!-- At Least One Condition Must Be True -->

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR Country = 'Norway';

<!-- Combining AND and OR -->

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
